# turtle_drone_flightpath

Project requirements are for a python project to read a text file in the format of route text files that have been uploaded:
The area is 12 x 12 box, the first two figures are the starting coordinates and the other values are compass points each indicating 1 unit travel in that direction.
The project now has a gui, asking for the file that contains the route you wish to plot.
The route is then plotted on a turtle window, the coordinates are printed on the command window and when the drone is outside the defined area an error message is displayed in the command window and pop up window.
There is now an executable which can be used to run the gui, it just requires the gif to be in the same folder.
